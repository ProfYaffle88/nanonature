        <h3>What is a Terrarium</h3>
        <p>Terrariums (or "Terraria" if you have a fondness for classical greek suffixes and don't mind your searches being cluttered by a very interesting game of the same name) are small glass vessels containing substrates, plants and animals (usually microscopic ones, we'll return to why all good terrariums have these later). They come in all shapes and sizes, and they can display examples of any biome (ecosystem) you can find on Earth . . . although some are much more challenging to reproduce that others! Terrariums can be Open or Closed, by which we mean they can be open to the air or sealed to form their own closed atmospheric system. Both kinds are beautiful additions to any shelf or desk, but in our opinion a Closed terrarium is much more interersting and challenging achievment!</p>
